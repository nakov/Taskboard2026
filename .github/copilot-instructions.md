# Taskboard

Taskboard is a Trello-style task management app built with JS and Supabase. Users register / login, then create projects, the view taskboard for each project, and create / edit / delete tasks on the taskboard. Tasks can be dragged and dropped between columns on the taskboard, and reordered within a column.

## Architecture and Tech Stack

Classical client-server app:
  - Front-end: JS app, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS
  - Back-end: Supabase
  - Database: PostgreSQL
  - Authentication: Supabase Auth
  - Build tools: Vite, npm
  - API: Supabase REST API
  - Hosting: Netlify
  - Source code: GitHub

## Modular Design

Use modular code structure, with separate files for different components, pages and features. Use ES6 modules to organize the code.

## UI Guidelines
  - Use HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Vanilla JS for the front-end.
  - Use Bootstrap components and utilities to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.
  - Implement modern, responsive UI design, with semantic HTML.
  - Use a consistent color scheme and typography throughout the app.
  - Use appropriate icons, effects and visual cues to enhance usability.

## Pages and Navigation
  - Split the app into multiple pages: login, registration, project list, taskboard, admin panel, etc.
  - Implement pages as reusable components (HTML, CSS and JS code).
  - Use routing to navigate between pages.
  - Use full URLs like: /, /login, /register, /projects, /projects/{id}/tasks, /admin, etc.

## Backend and Database
  - Use Supabase as the backend and database for the app.
  - Use PostgreSQL as the database, with tables for users, projects, tasks, etc.
  - Use Supabase Storage for file uploads (e.g. task attachments).
  - When changing the DB schema, always use migrations to keep track of changes.
  - After applying a migration in Supabase, keep a copy of the migration SQL file in the code.

## Authentication and Authorization
  - Use Supabase Auth for user authentication and authorization.
  - Implement RLS policies to restrict access to data based on user roles and permissions.
  - Implement user roles with a separate DB table `user_roles` + enum `roles` (e.g. admin, user).
